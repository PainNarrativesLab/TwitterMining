Mining twitter for pain narratives

This repository contains the machinery for mining twitter and saving to the tweets to the database. The analysis of the data is handled in a separate repository ( [PainNarrativesLab/TwitterDataAnalysis](PainNarrativesLab/TwitterDataAnalysis)).

PainNarrativesLab is a project for California State University, Northridge students to learn programming and data analysis skills while collaborating on articles for scholarly journals.
